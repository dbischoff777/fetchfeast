# Product Requirements Document: Fetch & Feast

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Fetch & Feast  
**Target Audience:** Dogs and their owners  
**Platform:** Web (Next.js)  
**Primary Target Device:** Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16+, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4+

## Executive Summary

Fetch & Feast is an interactive web-based game designed specifically for dogs. The game features animated objects that move across the screen in random patterns, which dogs can interact with by clicking/tapping. The game tracks scores, manages lives, and provides engaging visual feedback through animations and effects.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Landing Page

**Purpose:** Welcome users and their dogs, provide game entry point

**Features:**
- Welcoming interface optimized for tablet landscape/portrait orientations
- Large, prominent call-to-action button optimized for tablet touch interaction
- Modern, clean UI design following tablet-specific industry standards
- Tablet-first responsive design (768px - 1024px primary viewport)
- Dog-friendly visual elements (extra-large touch targets, high contrast, clear visual hierarchy)
- Full-screen immersive experience utilizing tablet screen real estate

**Technical Requirements:**
- Built using Next.js App Router
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- UI components from shadcn/ui library
- Tablet-optimized touch interactions (no hover states, touch-first design)
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Landscape and portrait orientation support

### 2. Game Core Mechanics

**Object Movement System:**
- Animated objects (using assets from `assets/animations/try/`) move around the screen
- Randomly generated movement patterns that are unpredictable
- Smooth, fluid animations (60fps target, using CSS transforms and requestAnimationFrame)
- Objects can appear at various positions on screen
- Movement should be continuous and natural-looking

**Object Behavior:**
- Objects can increase in size (pulse effect) for short periods
- Pulse animation should be smooth and attention-grabbing
- Pulse timing should be randomized to maintain unpredictability
- Objects should be large enough for dogs to easily interact with on tablets
- Minimum touch target size: 120x120px (tablet accessibility standard, suitable for dog paws/noses)
- Optimal object size: 150-200px for better visibility and interaction on tablet screens
- Objects should be positioned to avoid tablet bezels and safe areas

**Interaction System:**
- Touch/tap detection optimized for tablet screens (no mouse-specific interactions)
- Immediate visual feedback on successful interaction
- Responsive input handling (low latency, < 100ms touch response)
- Support for multi-touch (ignore accidental multi-touch, focus on primary touch)
- Touch event optimization to prevent scroll interference during gameplay

### 3. Visual Effects & Animations

**Success Feedback:**
- When object is successfully clicked, trigger firework animation
- Use random firework assets from `assets/animations/fireworks/` directory
- Firework animation should play at the click location
- Animation should complete before spawning next object
- Multiple firework variations should be randomly selected

**Object Animations:**
- Primary object animation from `assets/animations/try/Object_1.gif` (and variations)
- Smooth transitions between movement states
- No stuttering or frame drops during gameplay

### 4. Game State Management

**Score System:**
- Track total successful clicks/interactions
- Display score prominently during gameplay
- Use `assets/images/score.png` for score display UI element
- Score increments by 1 for each successful interaction
- Score persists throughout game session

**Lives System:**
- Total of 5 lives at game start
- Lose 1 life for each failed interaction (missed click or timeout)
- Display remaining lives using `assets/images/lives.png`
- Visual indicator showing current lives count
- Clear feedback when a life is lost

**Game Flow:**
- After successful click: show firework → spawn new object → continue
- After failed interaction: lose life → show feedback → spawn new object (if lives remain)
- When lives reach 0: transition to game over screen

### 5. Game Over Screen

**Features:**
- Display final score prominently
- Heartwarming, encouraging message for the next attempt
- Message should be positive and motivating
- "Replay" button to restart the game
- "Quit" button to exit to landing page
- Smooth transition animation from game to game over screen

**UI Requirements:**
- Extra-large, clear buttons optimized for tablet touch (minimum 120x120px)
- High contrast for readability on tablet screens
- Celebratory design elements that utilize tablet screen space effectively
- Buttons positioned in safe areas (avoiding tablet bezels and system UI)

### 6. Game Controls & Navigation

**In-Game Controls:**
- Quit button positioned at top-right corner, sized appropriately for tablet touch (minimum 80x80px)
- Quit button should be accessible at all times during gameplay
- Touch interaction should pause/exit game and return to landing page
- Confirmation dialog recommended for tablets (to prevent accidental exits from paw/nose touches)
- All controls must be in safe areas, avoiding tablet system UI overlays

**Navigation Flow:**
- Landing Page → Game → Game Over → (Replay or Quit)
- Landing Page → Game → Quit (at any time) → Landing Page

### 7. Technical Architecture

**Code Organization:**
- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns (UI, game logic, state management)
- Reusable components where applicable
- Clean, maintainable code following Next.js best practices
- TypeScript for type safety
