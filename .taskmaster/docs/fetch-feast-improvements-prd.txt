# Fetch & Feast - Enhancement PRD
## Version 1.1.0 - Sound System & UI/UX Improvements

### Project Overview
Fetch & Feast is an interactive touch-based game designed for dogs and their owners. The game challenges players to tap moving objects on screen to earn points while avoiding missclicks. This PRD outlines enhancements to add audio feedback and improve the overall user experience while maintaining simplicity and accessibility.

## 1. Sound System Implementation

### 1.1 Audio Feedback System
**Objective:** Add immersive audio feedback for game events to enhance engagement and provide clear feedback for dogs and their owners.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a sound manager system that handles all audio playback
- Support for multiple sound effects: success, failure, missclick, game over
- Volume control with mute/unmute functionality
- Audio should be optional and respect user preferences (localStorage)
- Preload audio files to prevent delay on first play
- Handle browser autoplay policies gracefully

**Sound Effects Needed:**
1. **Success Sound** - Play when player successfully taps a game object
   - Should be positive, encouraging, and brief (1-2 seconds)
   - Consider dog-friendly frequencies (avoid high-pitched sounds that may distress dogs)
   
2. **Failure Sound** - Play when player misses an object (timeout)
   - Should be neutral or slightly negative but not alarming
   - Brief duration (1-2 seconds)
   
3. **Missclick Sound** - Play when player clicks outside the game object
   - Similar to failure sound but distinct
   - Brief duration (1-2 seconds)
   
4. **Game Over Sound** - Play when game ends
   - Should be conclusive but not negative
   - Can be slightly longer (2-3 seconds)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create `app/game/utils/soundManager.ts` utility
- Use Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio for cross-browser compatibility
- Implement audio context management
- Add sound settings to game state or context
- Create sound toggle button in GameUI component

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All sound effects play correctly at appropriate times
- Volume control works and persists across sessions
- Mute/unmute button is visible and accessible
- No audio plays if user has muted
- Audio doesn't interfere with game performance
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## 2. UI/UX Enhancements

### 2.1 Sound Controls UI
**Objective:** Add intuitive sound controls that are easily accessible but don't clutter the interface.

**Requirements:**
- Add sound toggle button to GameUI component (next to quit button)
- Button should show current state (muted/unmuted) with clear iconography
- Use existing design system (yellow/blue theme)
- Ensure button is large enough for easy tapping (minimum 44x44px touch target)
- Add tooltip or aria-label for accessibility
- Position button in top-right area with other controls

**Design Specifications:**
- Icon: Speaker icon when unmuted, speaker-slash when muted
- Size: Match quit button dimensions (w-20 h-20 md:w-24 md:h-24)
- Styling: Consistent with existing GameUI buttons (yellow-200/95 background, blue-600 border)
- Animation: Subtle scale animation on tap/click

### 2.2 Landing Page Improvements
**Objective:** Enhance the landing page to be more engaging and informative.

**Requirements:**
- Add subtle background animations or patterns
- Improve visual hierarchy
- Add optional "How to Play" expandable section
- Consider adding a preview or demo animation
- Ensure all text is readable and accessible (WCAG AA contrast ratios)

**Enhancements:**
- Add gentle floating animation to mascot image
- Improve button hover states and transitions
- Add visual feedback on button press
- Consider adding a "Settings" or "About" section (optional)

### 2.3 Game Over Screen Enhancements
**Objective:** Make the game over experience more rewarding and informative.

**Requirements:**
- Add celebration animation or confetti effect
- Display performance metrics (optional):
  - Best score (if implementing high scores)
  - Accuracy percentage
  - Total objects caught
- Improve visual feedback for final score
- Add encouraging messages based on score ranges
- Consider adding share functionality (optional, future enhancement)

**Design Considerations:**
- Keep it simple - don't overwhelm with too much information
- Maintain the playful, dog-friendly aesthetic
- Ensure all text is readable and accessible

### 2.4 Visual Feedback Improvements
**Objective:** Enhance visual feedback throughout the game experience.

**Requirements:**
- Improve object hover/touch states (if applicable)
- Add subtle pulse or glow effect to game objects
- Enhance fail animation visibility
- Ensure all animations are smooth and performant
- Add loading states if needed

**Performance Considerations:**
- All animations should use CSS transforms and opacity (GPU-accelerated)
- Avoid layout shifts
- Maintain 60fps performance target

---

## 3. Accessibility Enhancements

### 3.1 Audio Accessibility
**Objective:** Ensure audio features don't exclude users who can't or don't want to use sound.

**Requirements:**
- All audio must be optional (never required)
- Visual feedback must accompany all audio feedback
- Sound controls must be keyboard accessible
- Screen reader announcements should continue to work without audio
- Respect system-level mute settings (if detectable)

### 3.2 Visual Accessibility
**Objective:** Maintain and improve visual accessibility standards.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure all new UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px
- Add proper ARIA labels to all new interactive elements
- Test with screen readers

---

## 4. Technical Improvements

### 4.1 Code Organization
**Objective:** Maintain clean, maintainable code structure.

**Requirements:**
- Create sound manager utility following existing code patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component structure and naming conventions
- Add proper error handling for audio loading failures
- Implement proper cleanup for audio contexts

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
**Objective:** Ensure audio doesn't impact game performance.

**Requirements:**
- Preload audio files efficiently
- Use audio sprites or compressed formats where appropriate
- Implement audio pooling if multiple sounds can play simultaneously
- Monitor performance impact and optimize as needed
- Consider lazy loading audio files

### 4.3 Browser Compatibility
**Objective:** Ensure audio works across all target browsers.

**Requirements:**
- Test on major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Handle autoplay policy restrictions gracefully
- Provide fallback for browsers without audio support
- Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## 5. User Experience Flow

### 5.1 First-Time User Experience
**Flow:**
1. User lands on homepage
2. Sees clear instructions and call-to-action
3. Clicks "Start Playing"
4. Game loads with sound enabled by default (respecting browser autoplay)
5. User can toggle sound at any time during gameplay

### 5.2 Returning User Experience
**Flow:**
1. User's sound preference is remembered (localStorage)
2. Game loads with previous sound setting
3. User can change sound setting at any time
4. Setting persists across sessions

### 5.3 Gameplay Experience
**Flow:**
1. Object appears on screen
2. User taps object → Success sound + visual feedback
3. User misses object (timeout) → Failure sound + visual feedback
4. User missclicks → Missclick sound + visual feedback
5. Game ends → Game over sound + celebration screen
